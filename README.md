Hello there! I am Faith:) 

This repository contains the files that were used and the programming aspect of my project, "Before and During Pandemic Transportation Patterns Analytics in Singapore". 

Feel free to use, should you feel that the files and codes are essential to your project too! 

Thank you :)
