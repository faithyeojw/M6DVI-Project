Hello, this is a quick explantion of the two sub-folders, "Codes" and "Datasets".

******

In the "Codes" folder, it contains the codes that I've typed to produce new datasets.

In the "Datasets" folder, it contains both the original and produced datasets.

1. "Cruise Ship Passengers Code" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Cruise Ship Passengers Data".
2. "Sea Cargo Code" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Sea Cargo Data".
3. "Sea Data Combination" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Sea Transportation Data".

Orignal Datasets Name:
1. Number of cruise ship passenger arrivals to Singapore from 2011 to 2020
