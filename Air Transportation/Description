Hello, this is a quick explantion of the two sub-folders, "Codes" and "Datasets".

******

In the "Codes" folder, it contains the codes that I've typed to produce new datasets.

In the "Datasets" folder, it contains both the original and produced datasets.

1. "Air Cargo Loaded Code" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Air Cargo Data".
2. "Civil Aircraft Arrivals, Passengers & Mail Code" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Civil Aircraft, Passengers and Mail Data".
3. "Air Data Combination" is meant for the NEW DATASET titled, "Air Transportation Data".

Orignal Datasets Name:
1. Air Cargo Loaded By RegionCountry Of Destination
