Hello:)

In the "Codes" folder, it contains the codes that I've typed to produce new datasets.

1. "Air Cargo Loaded Code" is meant for the dataset titled, "Air Cargo Data".
2. "Civil Aircraft Arrivals, Passengers & Mail Code" is meant for the dataset titled, "Civil Aircraft, Passengers and Mail Data".
3. "Air Data Combination" is meant for the dataset titled, "Air Transportation Data".
